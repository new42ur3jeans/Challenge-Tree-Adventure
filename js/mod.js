	<br>
	<h3>v2.2.3.2: FIGHTING A HELL BUG </h3><br>
	- Once again attempted to fix the issue where clicking + on tier 3 occasionally makes the variable add in unintentional ways (hopefully, PLEASE).<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v2.2.3.1: I'm too careless </h3><br>
	- Accidentally forgot to uncomment the part responsible for the autocompletion of tier 4 challenges last release.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v2.2.3: Can v2.2 be stable now please </h3><br>
	- <strike>ACTUALLY Fixed the issue where clicking + on tier 3 occasionally makes the variable add in the manner of strings (hopefully, PLEASE).</strike><b>WHY IS IT STILL ALIVE</b><br>
	- Scaled tier 4 dilemma challenges a BIT better I guess? <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v2.2.2: TWO HOTFIXES IN A ROW</h3><br>
	- Modified the gain formulae for positive and negative points after 5th dilemma challenge completion to avoid logarithm by 0 NaN.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v2.2.1: Decimals and Numbers</h3><br>
	- Adjusted some of the mathematical statements in tier 3 because it was reported people stopped getting points when clicking tier 3 buttons. <br>
	<br>
	<h3>v2.2: No longer a RobTop reference</h3><br>
	- Added the remaining 3 Dilemma Challenges to Tier 4. <br>
	- <strike>Fixed an issue where clicking + multiple times on tier 3 when starting at 0 would make the variable add in the manner of strings.</strike><b>TURNS OUT I DIDN'T WAUGHHHHHH</b><br>
	- Speaking of Tier 3, the leftmost buttons for Tier 3 are replaced with 1 because any value returning 0 halts production.<br>	
	<br>
	<h3>v2.(1 1/2): Fit-tertainment and QoL</h3><br>
	- Repeatable Challenges are now autocompleted as long as the player is inside the challenge. <br>
	- Added a mobile QoL button for mobile players to reset for tier 1 power in layer 2. <br>
	<br>
	<h3>v2.1: Balance Matters</h3><br>
	- Positive and Negative Point Nerfs are now exponented to ^0.5 so their reward would not be stuck at x10 without Dilemma Challenges.<br>
	- Effect of Positive and Negative Points now update based on Dilemma Challenge Effects.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v2: Balance and Dilemma</h3><br>
	- TIER FOUR HYPEEEEEEEEE <br>
	- Added 2 Dilemma challenges to Tier 4 (5 planned).<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v1.2.2: A little visual improvement, I guess</h3><br>
		- Added a forgotten line break in the change log. <br>
		- The second clickable is now wide enough to contain the word 'HALF'.<br>
    <br>
	<h3>v1.2.1: I should really be more careful</h3><br>
		- forgot to change version number on the top right hand corner lol, fixed that <br>
	<br>
    <h3>v1.2: Only a little better than v1.1, but still more than a hotfix</h3><br>
		- Multiple Measures Prevents b from being 0 in 'As Medium As Division' (because division by 0 error). <br>
		- Reverted formula variable visualization back to bars due to mobile users' requests.<br>
		- Added more buttons around the variable bars for better QoL.<br>
		- The Changelog is more pleasing in the eyes.<br>
	<br>
    <h3>v1.1.2: Hotfix?</h3><br>
        - changed the line displaying at the top of the page because the NaN bug is dead lol.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v1.1.1: Hotfix</h3><br>
		- Put back a forgotten line break on one of the challenges.<br>
		- Corrected the Author's Discord username.<br>
	<br>
    <h3>v1.1: IMPROVEMENT</h3><br>
		- DEFEATED THE NAN BUG<br>
		- Formatted the challenge goals of Tier 2.<br>
		- Kind of added some balance to Tier 3?<br>
		- Milestones of each layer are moved to the bottom of the tab.<br>
		- Tier 3 now uses sliders, no more clicking too many times!<br>
	<br>
	<h3>v1.0</h3><br>
		- Started Production.`
